	<h1>Bikes are fun. But why?</h1>
		<h2>This website is a reminder to the world that riding bikes is fun.</h2>
		<p class="bikelist">Here is an incomplete list of things that are less fun than riding bikes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Arguing about which bike has the best technology</li>
			<li>Making fun of people who ride different bikes than you</li>
			<li>Mocking trails that are different than your trails</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I hope this list reminds everyone that bikes should be fun to ride</p>
		<p class="bikelist">People should avoid arguments and making fun of people or trails</p>
